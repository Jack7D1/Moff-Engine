# Moff-Engine
This is a very simple graphical and IO engine meant to make 2D tile based programs easier for a beginning developer. 
This is not a professional or even acclaimed to be of any quality, rather it is an experiment as my first self contained windows interface.
More modules and helper functions will be provided with the engine as time goes on.
